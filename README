The stpl_theme plugin allows users of the application to choose there themes .
It allows designers to add more themes and make them available to the users in a flash !

Installation :

install plugin from 
script/plugin install git@github.com:stpl/stpl_theme

After installation run the below command from your application direcotry
rake stpl_theme:init
ruby script/genrate stpl_theme_migration
rake db:migrate

Add this line at the top of your route file
  map.resources :stpl_themes, :only => [:create]


You are all set now !

Now that you have the code in your app , add this line to the Model whom you want to enable to select their own theme

Class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  can_select_theme
# can_select_theme :default_theme_name 
The can_select_theme also takes a default theme name that you want to apply as default for an object of this model .

To give a nice little drop down selector for the user to choose a theme add this in your views
<%= theme_selector @user_obj %>

Finally to apply the themes , add this line in the end of your layout file
<%= apply_theme @user_obj %>

Note: It uses prototype for it's ajax operation so include prototype.js in this page. You can do that easily in rails using <%=javascript_include_tag :defaults %>

The plugin comes with a few cool default themes . However that does not stop you to add your own themes to it .
To add a new theme , make a new css file and add the name of the theme and the location of the css file in config/stpl_theme.yml . Restart the server .
Your new theme should now be visible to the user .

That's it ! Theme your way to glory  :)


Themes available:

1) default
